### Project-7---Python-Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis
# Project: Heart Disease Diagnostic Data Analysis
### Overview
I am thrilled to announce the completion of my project as a Data Analyst intern at Unified Mentor, focusing on analyzing heart disease diagnostic data using Python.

### Project Highlights
ETL Process: Managed heart disease data with a robust Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough analysis using Python, leveraging Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.
### Key Insights
Visualized heart disease distribution across demographics.
Identified patterns in age, gender, and chest pain types.
Utilized diverse visualizations like histograms and box plots for insights.
### Libraries Used
Python tools included Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

### Impact and Future Work
This project sharpened my data analysis skills and deepened my understanding of health data insights. Grateful for the mentorship from Unified Mentor, I look forward to applying these skills in future data analyst roles.
